<br>

I have a PhD in Computer Science at [University of Turin](http://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl), where I carried out my research with [my fantastic research group](https://arcs.di.unito.it/). My work is at the crossroad of Data Science, Network Science and Machine Learning.


A few projects of mine: <br>
üè¶ I worked on a big dataset made of [two years of wire transfers](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-020-00314-x) between people and businesses <br>
üíª I always monitor social networks, trying to understand [how disinformation propagates](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00342-w) <br>
üî¨ I built a domain-specific, fully-automated [search engine](http://fakenewsresearch.net/) for assisting the academic [research on disinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07909)  <br>
üòç I developed a tool for [detecting human emotions](https://github.com/alfonsosemeraro/emolib) in texts and then another one for [visualizing emotions](https://github.com/alfonsosemeraro/pyplutchik) <br>
üí• Sometimes I work on how to exploit the mathematical properties of [signed graphs](https://github.com/alfonsosemeraro/draw_signed_networkx), to make clear who is on which side of a conflict <br>

And many others: I'm always crunching numbers!


What do I do when I don't work? Well, I code ü§ì <br>
But yeah, also enjoy sports ‚öΩü•äüéæ
